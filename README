README

  Paroli is a fullscreen user interface for open devices written in
  python and edje.

COMPILE

  The python sources don't need to be compiled, but the edje files for
  the application do. To do so run build.sh in the paroli/application
  directory.

RUN

  See the instruction in the README file in paroli/script.
