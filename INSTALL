                            INSTALL PAROLI

On the desktop
--------------

It is possible to run paroli on the desktop even without an actual
phone.  The only needed things are :

  * python interpreter (>=2.5)
  * all e python binding (etk, efl, evas, edje)
  * a few standard python libraries (should already be present)

Once you have all those things (and of course downloaded paroli from
the git server), you first need to build the edje files (in the
directory paroli/applications):
  
  ./build.sh

Then you can start paroli as a standalone application (in
paroli/scripts):

  ./paroli

You are not supposed to install paroli on your desktop, you can always
run it directly from the source directory.


installing the e python bindings on the desktop
-----------------------------------------------

This may be the most difficult part, there are no packages I am aware
of (we need e17), so we need to build from sources.

The sources are situated at :

  svn co http://svn.enlightenment.org/svn/e

Then you need to follow the instructions from the sources to build,
first all the libraries, then all the python bindings.  To make sure
the installation did succeed we can try to import efl from a python
console :

  python
  > import edje


Running on the phone
--------------------

The best way to do so is to use FSO image, then copy paroli codes into
any location in the phone and run it the same way than on the desktop.

To avoid having to copy the sources at every change, it is possible to
keep the source on the desktop and use nfs to run it from the phone.
