This is a short document describing the changes that have to be made
and those that must be made for better integration of other services.
it also contains lot of cleanups.

DONE for the REBASE

+ solve import issue of apps (parts that are used in apps and services
  should not reside in the services directory. i introduced
  core/paroli/ to put those parts there).

+ remove nfs- (default installation location is /usr/share/paroli)

+ rename toplevel dirs (i removed the paroli- in front of the dirnames
  which makes typing alot easier).
