                            PAROLI SCRIPTS

* Standalone application

  To start paroli, first make sure that the edje files have been build
  (by running ./build in the paroli-applications directory.  Then just
  start paroli-launcher.

* With DBUS service

  To use the DBus service, dbus.activated must be set to True in the
  configuartion file.

  * Run it on the phone

    For the DBus connection to succedd, we need to make sure than the
    proper dbus configurations file are installed in the
    filesystem. That is the file
    ./data/dbus/org.tichy.launcher.service should go into
    /usr/share/dbus-1/system-services/ and the file
    ./data/dbus/tichy.conf should go in /etc/dbus-1/system.d/

    To start a application send a dbus call to org.tichy.launcher,
    object /Launcher method org.tichy.Launcher.Launch(s). The
    parameter being the name of the application we want to start.

    You can use dbus-send to make the call :

    dbus-send --system --dest='org.tichy.launcher' /Launcher \
    --print-reply org.tichy.Launcher.Launch string:Paroli-Contacts

    or you can use paroli-launcher --launch :

    paroli-launcher --launch Paroli-Contacts


  * Run it on the desktop

    It is basically the same, except that we can use the session bus
    instead of the system bus. Then we don't need to have the dbus
    conf file installed.

    To use the session bus, use the --session argument :

    paroli-launcher --session

    then to start an application (for example Paroli-Dialer) :

    paroli-launcher --session --launch Paroli-Dialer
